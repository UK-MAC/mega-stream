# mega-stream and mega-sweep

## mega-stream

The mega-stream mini-app initially aimed to test the theory that streaming many arrays (with different sizes)
causes memory bandwidth limits not to be reached; resulting in latency becoming a dominant factor.
We ran a kernel with a similar form to STREAM Triad, but with more than 3 input arrays.
Additionally we run a small reduction, requiring results of the Triad-style computation.

This was then extended to also include a finite difference style update on the medium side arays.

### The kernel

The main kernel consists of 8 multi-dimensional arrays with the following properties:

 * r and q are large
 * x, y and z are medium
 * a, b, and c are small

The computational kernel is found inside a triple-nested loop, and can be expressed as

```
r(i,j,k,l,m) = q(i,j,k,l,m) + a(i)*x(i,j,k,m) + b(i)*y(i,j,l,m) + c(i)*z(i,k,l,m)
x(i,j,k,m) = 0.2*r(i,j,k,l,m) - x(i,j,k,m)
y(i,j,l,m) = 0.2*r(i,j,k,l,m) - y(i,j,l,m)
z(i,k,l,m) = 0.2*r(i,j,k,l,m) - z(i,k,l,m)
sum(j,k,l,m) = SUM(r(:,j,k,l,m))
```

### Building

The benchmark should build with `make`, and by default uses the Intel compiler.
This can be changed by specifying `CC`, for example `make CC=cc`.
Additional options can be passed to the Makefile as `make OPTIONS=`.

### Notes

The Fortran version does not have any command line argument checking.
A baseline and an optimised version are kept in this repository.


## mega-sweep

The mega-sweep mini-app aims to take the mega-stream kernel and fit it within a KBA-style sweep iteration structure.
The compute kernel is similar to mega-stream, but additional looping along with MPI communication is included.

This mini-app is Fortran only. There are 2- and 3-spatial dimensions versions available.
The 3D version decomposes in the YZ dimensions.

Sweep timings are printed out for each sweep direction. Note that these are from MPI rank 0, which means that some
sweeps may appear to take longer than others. This is due to the start-up costs associated with the KBA sweep.

### Building

The benchmark should build with `make`, and by default uses the default MPI compiler.
A compiler toolchain should be specified with `COMPILER`, for example `make COMPILER=INTEL`.
Additional options can be passed to the Makefile as `make OPTIONS=`.
